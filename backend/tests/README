Testing backend server settings (settings/)
===========================================

The tests for the backend server settings include settings files and a semi-automated testing script. The tests are especially intended to make sure that the settings reload timeout and possible index changes work properly while the server is running.

To use the semi-automated testing script, in some clean directory create indexes in directories first.index, second.index, and third.index so that the same query will produce obviously different results on the three indexes. For example, the results for examplequeries/views/descriptions.json will have distinct numbers of different hits and distinct byte sizes at the receiving end if you put 10, 20, and 30 events in the three indexes respectively and leave the description page size at 50.

In the same directory run the script and pass it the path to the test files directory. When prompted, start the backend server on the settings.conf settings file the script produces, and use querybackend to run repeated queries at small delays (eg -r 1000 -s 1, using examplequeries/views/descriptions.json if the three indexes were created as suggested above). Watch the output from both for the expected changes (with the delay for the settings reload timeout) as indicated by the script.
