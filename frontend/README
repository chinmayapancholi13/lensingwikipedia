Web visualization frontend.

The frontend interfaces with the backend by sending queries in a JSON format. See the backend documentation for details on these queries.

Usage
=====

I've been using the frontend locally so far. Just open frontend/index.html as a file in a browser, or serve it locally, eg:
        cd frontend/
        python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer
If you changed the port of the backend or are serving it on a different computer than the frontend, then edit config.js.
